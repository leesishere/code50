# When texting or tweeting, itâ€™s not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels,
# much like Twitter was originally called twttr. In a file called twttr.py, implement a program that prompts
# the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted,
# whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.

# list of vowels
vowels = [A, E, I, O, U]

def main():
    c = input("Input: ")
    print("output: " end="")
    for c in s:
        print(c, end="")
    print()
